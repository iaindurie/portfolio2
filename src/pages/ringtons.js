        <p>I designed and helped build a Universal Windows app for Ringtons.</p> 
        <p>The app helps Ringtons delivery drivers plan and execute their working day.
          It allows them to view and organise their delivery schedule, manage users, reconcile stock and take payments - making their 
          working day more efficient, and their ability to sell items easier.</p>
